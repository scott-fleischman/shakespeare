     A very, very—pajock.
     An thou hadst not come to my bed.
     And his sandal shoon.
     And we cast away moan.
     As if I had never been such.
     At his heels a stone.
     But never doubt I love.
     By Cock, they are to blame.
     For such a guest is meet.
     Never departed more.
     O methought there was nothing meet.
     So runs the world away.
     To be your Valentine.
     With true-love showers.
     You promis’d me to wed.
   All flaxen was his poll.
   Did nothing.
   For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.
   God ha’ mercy on his soul.
   He never will come again.
   It came to pass, as most like it was.
   Now falls on Priam.
   Of reverend Priam, seem’d i’ th’air to stick.
   White his shroud as the mountain snow.
   Why then, belike he likes it not, perdie.
   ’Gainst Fortune’s state would treason have pronounc’d.

 The King rises and advances.
 Trumpets sound. The dumb show enters.
A Norman.
A couch for luxury and damned incest.
A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
A document in madness, thoughts and remembrance fitted.
A dream itself is but a shadow.
A hit, a very palpable hit.
A mote it is to trouble the mind’s eye.
A piece of him.
A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.
A sable silver’d.
A touch, a touch, I do confess.
A truant disposition, good my lord.
A whole one, I.
A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends.
ALL.
Adieu, adieu, adieu. Hamlet, remember me.
Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.
Affront Ophelia.
After the thing it loves.
Against some part of Poland.
Against yourself. I know you are no truant.
Ah, ha! Come, some music. Come, the recorders.
Alas, he’s mad.
Alas, my lord, I have been so affrighted.
All given to mine ear.
All may be well.
All my smooth body.
All.
And I am sick at heart.
And I believe it is a fetch of warrant.
And a man’s life’s no more than to say ‘One’.
And all we wail for.
And as my love is siz’d, my fear is so.
And bear it to the chapel.
And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
And break your own neck down.
And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
And call it accident.
And call the noblest to the audience.
And draw you into madness? Think of it.
And drive his purpose on to these delights.
And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest.
And for that purpose I’ll anoint my sword.
And from his mother’s closet hath he dragg’d him.
And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more.
And gem of all the nation.
And he to England shall along with you.
And hears it roar beneath.
And hurt my brother.
And lay your hands again upon my sword.
And let him know so.
And let him ply his music.
And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
And let us hear Barnardo speak of this.
And liegemen to the Dane.
And live the purer with the other half.
And never come mischance between us twain.
And not have strew’d thy grave.
And not where I had aim’d them.
And of all Christian souls, I pray God. God b’ wi’ ye.
And our affairs from England come too late.
And our vain blows malicious mockery.
And prey on garbage.
And reason panders will.
And recks not his own rede.
And scape detecting, I will pay the theft.
And so I do still, by these pickers and stealers.
And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.
And tell you what I know.
And that our drift look through our bad performance.
And the Queen too, and that presently.
And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
And they shall hear and judge ’twixt you and me.
And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more.
And to the last bended their light on me.
And vanish’d from our sight.
And where th’offence is let the great axe fall.
And will not wrong it.
And you are stay’d for. There, my blessing with you.
And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
And you, the judges, bear a wary eye.
And your poor servant ever.
And ’gins to pale his uneffectual fire.
And, would it were not so. You are my mother.
Answer, and think upon this business.
Are base respects of thrift, but none of love.
Are joyfully return’d.
Are of a most select and generous chief in that.
Arm’d, my lord.
As I do thee. Something too much of this.
As day does to your eye.
As e’er my conversation cop’d withal.
As fits a king’s remembrance.
As hardy as the Nemean lion’s nerve.
As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays.
As it behoves my daughter and your honour.
As kill a king and marry with his brother.
As of a man faithful and honourable.
As the indifferent children of the earth.
As therein are set down.
As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
As to peace-parted souls.
As will not leave their tinct.
As woman’s love.
Assume a virtue, if you have it not.
At home, my lord.
At least I am sure it may be so in Denmark.
At such a time I’ll loose my daughter to him.
At supper.
Ay, Hamlet.
Ay, amen.
Ay, by heaven, my lord.
Ay, fashion you may call it; go to, go to.
Ay, good my lord.
Ay, madam, it is common.
Ay, marry, is’t, crowner’s quest law.
Ay, my good lord.
Ay, my lord, I would know that.
Ay, my lord, and of calf-skins too.
Ay, my lord.
Ay, my lord; they stay upon your patience.
Ay, sir, but while the grass grows—the proverb is something musty.
Ay, so, God b’ wi’ ye. Now I am alone.
Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.
Ay, that they do, my lord. Hercules and his load too.
Ay, very well, my lord.
BARNARDO.
BOTH.
Barnardo has my place. Give you good-night.
Be all my sins remember’d.
Be buried quick with her, and so will I.
Be but to sleep and feed? A beast, no more.
Be not too tame neither; but let your own discretion be your tutor.
Be rul’d; you shall not go.
Be soft as sinews of the new-born babe.
Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.
Be wary then, best safety lies in fear.
Bear’t that th’opposed may beware of thee.
Becomes the field, but here shows much amiss.
Believe me, I cannot.
Belike this show imports the argument of the play.
Bestow this place on us a little while.
Bid the players make haste.
Both.
Bring him before us.
Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye.
But break my heart, for I must hold my tongue.
But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.
But do not go with it.
But fall unshaken when they mellow be.
But farewell it, for I will use no art.
But from what cause he will by no means speak.
But he’s an arrant knave.
But keep a farm and carters.
But let me hear from you.
But let that go.
But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.
But look, amazement on thy mother sits.
But not by him.
But our cold maids do dead men’s fingers call them.
But pardon’t as you are a gentleman.
But since he is better’d, we have therefore odds.
But soft! but soft! aside! Here comes the King.
But that this folly douts it.
But this most foul, strange, and unnatural.
But what we do determine, oft we break.
But with much forcing of his disposition.
Buzz, buzz.
By and by is easily said. Leave me, friends.
By heaven, I’ll make a ghost of him that lets me.
By indirections find directions out.
By the mass, and ’tis like a camel indeed.
CAPTAIN.
CORNELIUS and VOLTEMAND.
Calmly, good Laertes.
Come for the third, Laertes. You do but dally.
Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.
Come on, sir.
Come on, you hear this fellow in the cellarage.
Come short of what he did.
Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.
Come, come, and sit you down, you shall not budge.
Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.
Come, go with me. I will go seek the King.
Come, let me wipe thy face.
Come, my lord.
Come, one for me.
Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you.
Come, sirs.
Come, some music.
Compounded it with dust, whereto ’tis kin.
Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works.
Conceit upon her father.
Consent to swear.
Contagious blastments are most imminent.
Cornelius, Lords and Attendant.
Couch we awhile and mark.
Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness.
DANES.
Danes.
Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.
Dead.
Delay it not; I’ll have him hence tonight.
Denmark being one o’ th’ worst.
Denmark’s a prison.
Devoutly to be wish’d. To die, to sleep.
Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
Did sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee speak.
Did the King sigh, but with a general groan.
Directly seasons him his enemy.
Do not believe it.
Do not, my lord.
Do, if it will not stand.
Does by their own insinuation grow.
Does not divide the Sunday from the week.
Drown’d, drown’d.
Each toy seems prologue to some great amiss.
Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry,—as ’twere—I cannot tell how.
Excellent well. You’re a fishmonger.
Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet.
E’en so, my lord.
E’en so.
E’en that.
FIRST AMBASSADOR.
FIRST CLOWN.
FIRST PLAYER.
FIRST SAILOR.
FORTINBRAS.

Faith no, as you may season it in the charge.
Faith, e’en with losing his wits.
Faith, her privates we.
Fare you well, my lord.
Farewell.
Farewell: my blessing season this in thee.
Farewell; and let your haste commend your duty.
Follow her close; give her good watch, I pray you.
Follow him, friends. We’ll hear a play tomorrow.
Follow my mother.
For England.
For God’s love let me hear.
For her perfections. But my revenge will come.
For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune.
For my part, I do not lie in’t, yet it is mine.
For no man, sir.
For none neither.
For this effect defective comes by cause.
Fordo it own life. ’Twas of some estate.
Friends to this ground.
GENTLEMAN.
GHOST.
GUILDENSTERN.
Gertrude, do not drink.
Get you a place.
Give him the cup.
Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.
Give it an understanding, but no tongue.
Give me my father.
Give me one poor request.
Give me some light. Away.
Give me the cup. Let go; by Heaven, I’ll have’t.
Give o’er the play.
Give us the foils; come on.
Give you good night.
Gives me superfluous death.
Go on, I’ll follow thee.
Go softly on.
Go to your rest, at night we’ll feast together:.
Go to.
Go, Captain, from me greet the Danish king.
Go, bid the soldiers shoot.
Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.
God bless you, sir.
God b’ wi’ you, fare you well.
God b’ wi’ you, sir.
Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.
Good madam, stay awhile; I will be faithful.
Good madam.
Good my lord, be quiet.
Good my lord, tell it.
Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.
Good my lord.
Good night, ladies; good night, sweet ladies; good night, good night.
Good night, mother.
Good night. But go not to mine uncle’s bed.
Good.
Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.
HAMLET.
HORATIO and MARCELLUS.
HORATIO.
Had it th’ability of life to thank you.
Half a share.
Hamlet o’ercame Fortinbras.
Hamlet the Dane.
Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.
Hath given me this. Now gather, and surmise.
Have at you now.
Have of your audience been most free and bounteous.
He is justly serv’d.
He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
He never gave commandment for their death.
He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
He was the first that ever bore arms.
He waxes desperate with imagination.
He will stay till you come.
He.
Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.
Heaven will direct it.
Her mood will needs be pitied.
Here in the lobby.
Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows.
Here, sweet lord, at your service.
Here’s the commission, read it at more leisure.
Here’s to thy health.
Here’s yet some liquor left.
He’s fat, and scant of breath.
He’s for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps.
Hillo, ho, ho, boy! Come, bird, come.
His access to me.
His father’s death and our o’erhasty marriage.
His madness is poor Hamlet’s enemy.
His purse is empty already, all’s golden words are spent.
His silence will sit drooping.
Ho, Guildenstern! Bring in my lord.
Hold off your hands.
Horatio, as I am let to know it is.
Horatio, or I do forget myself.
Horatio, tell me one thing.
How I am punish’d with sore distraction.
How came he dead? I’ll not be juggled with.
How cheerfully on the false trail they cry.
How now, Horatio! You tremble and look pale.
Howe’er my haps, my joys were ne’er begun.
I am afeard you make a wanton of me.
I am dead, Horatio. Wretched Queen, adieu.
I am glad of it. A knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear.
I am justly kill’d with mine own treachery.
I am more an antique Roman than a Dane.
I am tame, sir, pronounce.
I beseech you.
I can no more. The King, the King’s to blame.
I commend my duty to your lordship.
I dare not drink yet, madam. By and by.
I did very well note him.
I do beseech you give him leave to go.
I do beseech you.
I do not know, my lord, what I should think.
I do not think’t.
I had forgot. ’Tis so concluded on.
I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet; these words are not mine.
I have seen nothing.
I have sent to seek him and to find the body.
I have sworn’t.
I have, my lord.
I hear him coming. Let’s withdraw, my lord.
I hope we have reform’d that indifferently with us, sir.
I humbly thank you; well, well, well.
I knew you must be edified by the margin ere you had done.
I know no touch of it, my lord.
I lov’d you ever. But it is no matter.
I mean the matter that you read, my lord.
I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.
I never gave you aught.
I pray thee stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.
I pray thee, good Horatio, wait upon him.
I pray you go with me.
I pray you pass with your best violence.
I pray you, give me leave.
I pray you, now receive them.
I pray you.
I prithee do not mock me, fellow-student.
I saw him once; he was a goodly king.
I say, away!—Go on, I’ll follow thee.
I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
I shall not look upon his like again.
I shall obey you.
I shall obey, my lord.
I shall, my lord.
I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.
I stay too long. But here my father comes.
I thank your lordship, ’tis very hot.
I think it be thine indeed, for thou liest in’t.
I think it lacks of twelve.
I think it was to see my mother’s wedding.
I think nothing, my lord.
I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late innovation.
I understand you not, my lord.
I warrant you it will.
I warrant your honour.
I was the more deceived.
I will be brief. Your noble son is mad.
I will do’t, my lord.
I will do’t.
I will not speak with her.
I will requite your loves. So, fare ye well.
I will say so.
I will, my lord.
I will, my lord; I pray you pardon me.
I will.
I would I had been there.
If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.
If she unmask her beauty to the moon.
If this did blast in proof. Soft, let me see.
If, once a widow, ever I be wife.
In censure of his seeming.
In faith, my lord, not I.
In happy time.
In honourable fashion.
In my mind’s eye, Horatio.
In neither aught, or in extremity.
In that, and all things, will we show our duty.
In the same figure, like the King that’s dead.
Indeed la, without an oath, I’ll make an end on’t.
Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.
Indeed, my lord, it follow’d hard upon.
Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.
Into a tow’ring passion.
Into the chapel. I pray you haste in this.
Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
Is in his retirement, marvellous distempered.
Is thought-sick at the act.
Is very cunning in.
It could not move thus.
It faded on the crowing of the cock.
It falls right.
It had been so with us, had we been there.
It is a nipping and an eager air.
It is a poison temper’d by himself.
It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you.
It is backed like a weasel.
It is here, Hamlet. Hamlet, thou art slain.
It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.
It is not, nor it cannot come to good.
It is offended.
It may be death.
It may be, very likely.
It might, my lord.
It shall be so.
It shall to the barber’s, with your beard.—Prythee say on.
It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.
It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
It waves me forth again. I’ll follow it.
It waves me still.
It waves you to a more removed ground.
It will not speak; then will I follow it.
It would be spoke to.
It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.
It would have much amaz’d you.
Itself to motion, like as it would speak.
I’ll be with you straight. Go a little before.
I’ll board him presently. O, give me leave.
I’ll lug the guts into the neighbour room.
I’ll play this bout first; set it by awhile.
I’ll rant as well as thou.
I’ll visit you.
I’ll warrant you, Fear me not.
Judgment.

LAERTES.
LORD.
LUCIANUS.
Laertes, you shall hear them.
Leave us.
Let her come in.
Let him bless thee too.
Let him demand his fill.
Let him go, Gertrude. Do not fear our person.
Let me be cruel, not unnatural.
Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet.
Let them come in.
Letters, my lord, from Hamlet.
Let’s follow; ’tis not fit thus to obey him.
Lights, lights, lights.
Like a good child and a true gentleman.
Like quills upon the fretful porcupine.
Longer, longer.
Look to’t, I charge you; come your ways.
Look where he goes even now out at the portal.
Look you, I’ll go pray.
Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.
MARCELLUS and BARNARDO.
MARCELLUS.
MESSENGER.
Madam, I swear I use no art at all.
Madam, I wish it may.
Madness in great ones must not unwatch’d go.
Make us again count o’er ere love be done.
Mar. and BARNARDO.
Mark me.
Marry, now I can tell.
Marry, this is miching mallicho; it means mischief.
Mass, I cannot tell.
May sweep to my revenge.
Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour.
Methinks it is like a weasel.
Methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion.
Might stop a hole to keep the wind away.
Mine, sir.
More grief to hide than hate to utter love.
More honour’d in the breach than the observance.
More matter, with less art.
Most constantly.
Most fair return of greetings and desires.
Most free in his reply.
Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
Most like a gentleman.
Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.
Most throughly for my father.
Most welcome home.
Mother, you have my father much offended.
Much heat and him. I’ll silence me e’en here.
Must render up myself.
My crown, mine own ambition, and my queen.
My father,—methinks I see my father.
My good lord.
My head should be struck off.
My honourable lord, I will most humbly take my leave of you.
My lord, I came to see your father’s funeral.
My lord, I cannot.
My lord, I did intend it.
My lord, I do not know, but truly I do fear it.
My lord, I have news to tell you.
My lord, I have.
My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
My lord, I will use them according to their desert.
My lord, I’ll hit him now.
My lord, from head to foot.
My lord, he’s going to his mother’s closet.
My lord, that would dishonour him.
My lord, the King your father.
My lord, the Queen would speak with you, and presently.
My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.
My lord, upon the platform where we watch.
My lord, we were sent for.
My lord, we will not.
My lord, you must tell us where the body is and go with us to the King.
My lord, you once did love me.
My necessaries are embark’d. Farewell.
My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.
My soul is full of discord and dismay.
My thoughts be bloody or be nothing worth.
My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites.
My will, not all the world.
My words fly up, my thoughts remain below.
Nay, I know not.
Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself.
Nay, but swear’t.
Nay, come, let’s go together.
Nay, good my lord.
Nay, let’s follow him.
Nay, that follows not.
Nay, then I’ll set those to you that can speak.
Nay, very pale.
Nay, ’tis twice two months, my lord.
Neither, my lord.
Never believe it.
Never make known what you have seen tonight.
Never to rise again. Thy mother’s poison’d.
Never to speak of this that you have heard.
Never to speak of this that you have seen.
No medicine in the world can do thee good.
No more be done.
No more, sweet Hamlet.
No more.
No, believe me, ’tis very cold, the wind is northerly.
No, by no means.
No, by the rood, not so.
No, by this hand.
No, good mother, here’s metal more attractive.
No, indeed, they are not.
No, it is struck.
No, let’s come in.
No, my good lord.
No, my lord.
No, my lord; rather with choler.
No, no, they do but jest, poison in jest; no offence i’ th’ world.
No, not I.
No, nothing but ourselves.
No, you’ll reveal it.
No.
None but his enemies.
None wed the second but who kill’d the first.
None, my lord, but that the world’s grown honest.
Nor I, my lord, in faith.
Nor I, my lord.
Nor any unproportion’d thought his act.
Nor thine on me.
Not I, my lord, by heaven.
Not I, my lord.
Not a jot more, my lord.
Not a mouse stirring.
Not shriving-time allow’d.
Not so, my lord, I am too much i’ the sun.
Not that I know.
Not when I saw’t.
Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.
Nothing neither way.
Nothing.
Now might I do it pat, now he is praying.
Now wears his crown.
O Hamlet, speak no more.
O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.
O confound the rest.
O day and night, but this is wondrous strange.
O my dear lord.
O my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too unmannerly.
O speak of that, that do I long to hear.
O step between her and her fighting soul.
O yes, my lord, he wore his beaver up.
O yet defend me, friends. I am but hurt.
O, I die, Horatio.
O, but she’ll keep her word.
O, fear me not.
O, he is mad, Laertes.
O, there has been much throwing about of brains.
O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs.

OSRIC.
Observe his inclination in yourself.
Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
Of bell and burial.
Of blue Olympus.
Of general assault.
Of him that brought them.
Of him, sir.
Of his affection to me.
Of his behaviour.
Of his true state.
Of man and country.
Of mighty opposites.
Of mine own eyes.
Of my true mother.
Of nothing. Bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.
Of the unworthiest siege.
Of these dilated articles allow.
Of this post-haste and rummage in the land.
On Fortinbras. He has my dying voice.
On Fortune’s cap we are not the very button.
On plots and errors happen.
On wholesome life usurp immediately.
One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she’s dead.
One word more, good lady.
One.
Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio.
Or like a whale.
Or not at all.
Or pardon’d being down? Then I’ll look up.
Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
Our duty to your honour.
Our purpose may hold there.
Our son shall win.
Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own.
Out of his lunacies.
Out of the shot and danger of desire.
Over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.
Over the nasty sty.

Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.

SECOND CLOWN.
SERVANT.
Safely stowed.
Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not.
Sailors, sir. They say they have letters for you.
Save yourself, my lord.
Say on; come to Hecuba.
Say you so? Come on.
Say you? Nay, pray you mark.
See, it stalks away.
Seek for thy noble father in the dust.
Seems, madam! Nay, it is; I know not seems.
Set me the stoups of wine upon that table.
Shards, flints, and pebbles should be thrown on her.
She desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go to bed.
She is importunate, indeed distract.
She swoons to see them bleed.
She turns to favour and to prettiness.
She well instructs me.
Should patch a wall t’expel the winter’s flaw.
Shows itself pure. He weeps for what is done.
Sir, I cannot.
Sir, I lack advancement.
Sir, a whole history.
So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to’t.
So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.
So fast they follow. Your sister’s drown’d, Laertes.
So hallow’d and so gracious is the time.
So have I heard, and do in part believe it.
So he does indeed.
So is it, if thou knew’st our purposes.
So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.
So you shall.
So you will not o’errule me to a peace.
So, proceed you.
Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
Speak loudly for him.
Speak to her, Hamlet.
Speak to me.
Speak, I am bound to hear.
Speak, man.
Stick fiery off indeed.
Still am I call’d. Unhand me, gentlemen.
Still better, and worse.
Such love must needs be treason in my breast.
Swear by my sword.
Swear.
Take each man’s censure, but reserve thy judgment.
Take this from this, if this be otherwise.
Than is my deed to my most painted word.
Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
Than to entreaty.
Than your particular demands will touch it.
Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz.
Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.
Thanks, dear my lord.
That I have longed long to re-deliver.
That I might be the organ.
That I must be their scourge and minister.
That I must call’t in question.
That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.
That did I, my lord, and was accounted a good actor.
That else leans on th’affair. Pray you make haste.
That ever I was born to set it right.
That hath in it no profit but the name.
That hath made him mad.
That is Laertes, a very noble youth. Mark.
That is most certain.
That it is proof and bulwark against sense.
That live and feed upon your Majesty.
That makes calamity of so long life.
That not your trespass, but my madness speaks.
That our devices still are overthrown.
That shows his hoary leaves in the glassy stream.
That thus he suffers for.
That was and is the question of these wars.
That you know aught of me:—this not to do.
That, open’d, lies within our remedy.
That’s a fair thought to lie between maids’ legs.
That’s good! ‘Mobled queen’ is good.
That’s two of his weapons. But well.
That’s very true, my lord.
The King and Queen and all are coming down.
The King rises.
The Queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.
The actors are come hither, my lord.
The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
The better to beguile. This is for all.
The carriages, sir, are the hangers.
The cat will mew, and dog will have his day.
The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.
The death I gave him. So again, good night.
The devil himself.
The doors are broke.
The drink, the drink! I am poison’d.
The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a thousand tenants.
The head and source of all your son’s distemper.
The lady protests too much, methinks.
The nephew to old Norway, Fortinbras.
The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.
The pith and marrow of our attribute.
The portraiture of his. I’ll court his favours.
The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
The tedious day with sleep.
The time invites you; go, your servants tend.
The triumph of his pledge.
The unseen good old man.
The very cause of Hamlet’s lunacy.
The very same.
The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen.
Their own enactures with themselves destroy.
Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.
Then I would you were so honest a man.
Then is the world one.
Then, venom, to thy work.
There are the players.
There is a play tonight before the King.
There, my lord.
Therefore let’s follow.
There’s no offence, my lord.
These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
These hands are not more like.
These tedious old fools.
They are coming to the play. I must be idle.
They are of Norway, sir.
They have proclaim’d their malefactions.
They shall go far with little.
Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me.
Think it no more.
This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
This business is well ended.
This grave shall have a living monument.
This is one Lucianus, nephew to the King.
This is the very coinage of your brain.
This is too heavy. Let me see another.
This is too long.
This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.
This man shall set me packing.
This marvel to you.
This night to play before him.
This nothing’s more than matter.
This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.
This present object made probation.
This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
This to your Majesty; this to the Queen.
This warlike volley.
This was your husband. Look you now what follows.
Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
Thou canst not then be false to any man.
Thou know’st already.
Thou pray’st not well.
Thou still hast been the father of good news.
Though all the earth o’erwhelm them, to men’s eyes.
Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.
Thus bad begins, and worse remains behind.
Thy loving father, Hamlet.
Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.
Till I have caught her once more in mine arms.
Till then in patience our proceeding be.
Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.
To be commanded.
To both your honours.
To cut his throat i’ th’ church.
To give it due content.
To give the world assurance of a man.
To give them seals never, my soul, consent.
To give th’assay of arms against your Majesty.
To hear and see the matter.
To hear him so inclin’d.
To heaven. O, this is hire and salary, not revenge.
To him from whom you brought them.
To his own scandal.
To his unmaster’d importunity.
To lack discretion. Come, go we to the King.
To let you know of it.
To muddy death.
To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt.
To speak of horrors, he comes before me.
To tell my story.
To tell us this.
To the unsatisfied.
To this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will.
To visit you, my lord, no other occasion.
To what I shall unfold.
To you alone.
To you yourself, to us, to everyone.
To youth and liberty.
Together with remembrance of ourselves.
Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us.
To’t.
Treachery! Seek it out.
Truly deliver.
Tush, tush, ’twill not appear.
T’have seen what I have seen, see what I see.
Unite commutual in most sacred bands.
Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
Until my eyelids will no longer wag.
Unto our climatures and countrymen.
Upon his will I seal’d my hard consent.
Upon my honour.
Upon my life, Lamond.
Upon my sword.
VOLTEMAND.
Very good, my lord.
Very like a whale.
Very strangely, they say.
Very well, my lord.
Very well. Follow that lord, and look you mock him not.
Walks o’er the dew of yon high eastward hill.
Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.
Was’t Hamlet wrong’d Laertes? Never Hamlet.
We cannot get from him.
We do, my lord.
We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.
We fat all creatures else to fat us, and we fat ourselves for maggots.
We have sworn, my lord, already.
We shall, my lord.
We think not so, my lord.
We will haste us.
We will ourselves provide.
We will try it.
We will, my lord.
We will, we will.
Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.
Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
Well be with you, gentlemen.
Well, God-a-mercy.
Well, good night.
Well, my lord.
Well, we shall sift him.
Well; again.
Were nothing but to waste night, day and time.
We’ll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
We’ll wait upon you.
What I have said to you.
What is between you? Give me up the truth.
What is the issue of the business there.
What is’t, my lord? We will.
What noise? Who calls on Hamlet? O, here they come.
What thou hast said to me.
What we two nights have seen.
When he is fit and season’d for his passage? No.
When in one line two crafts directly meet.
When second husband kisses me in bed.
When thou liest howling.
Where are my Switzers? Let them guard the door.
Where is this king?—Sirs, stand you all without.
Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.
Where we shall find him most conveniently.
Where you may see the inmost part of you.
Wherein I’ll catch the conscience of the King.
Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.
Which I have told thee, of my father’s death.
Which have solicited. The rest is silence.
Which now goes too free-footed.
Which now to claim my vantage doth invite me.
While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
Whither wilt thou lead me? Speak, I’ll go no further.
Who was in life a foolish peating knave.
Why day is day, night night, and time is time.
Why the man dies. I humbly thank you, sir.
Why, as a woodcock to my own springe, Osric.
Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.
Why, he had none.
Why, man, they did make love to this employment.
Why, then the Polack never will defend it.
Why, then your ambition makes it one; ’tis too narrow for your mind.
Why, ’tis a loving and a fair reply.
Why, ’tis found so.
Will want true colour; tears perchance for blood.
Will you do this, keep close within your chamber.
With all my imperfections on my head.
With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
Withdraw, I hear him coming.
Within the centre.
Without the which we are pictures or mere beasts.
Without, my lord, guarded, to know your pleasure.
Words without thoughts never to heaven go.
Words, words, words.
Would quake to look on. Soft now, to my mother.
Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear.
Yaughan; fetch me a stoup of liquor.
Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.
Yes faith, heartily.
Yes, it is already garrison’d.
Yet here, Laertes? Aboard, aboard, for shame.
You are a good chorus, my lord.
You are keen, my lord, you are keen.
You are merry, my lord.
You are naught, you are naught: I’ll mark the play.
You are welcome, masters, welcome all. I am glad to see thee well.
You are welcome.
You come most carefully upon your hour.
You go to seek the Lord Hamlet; there he is.
You lie out on’t, sir, and therefore ’tis not yours.
You mainly were stirr’d up.
You might have rhymed.
You mock me, sir.
You must translate. ’tis fit we understand them.
You shall not go, my lord.
You will lose this wager, my lord.
Your Grace has laid the odds o’ the weaker side.
Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.
Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.
Your loves, as mine to you: farewell.
Your sudden coming o’er to play with him.
Your wisdom best shall think.
Yours, yours.
