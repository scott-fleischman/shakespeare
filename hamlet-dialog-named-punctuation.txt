500  [_Aside._] A little more than kin, and less than kind.

1406 [_Within._] My lord, my lord.

1409 [_Within._] Lord Hamlet.

1412 [_Within._] Heaven secure him.

1418 [_Within._] Illo, ho, ho, my lord!

1517 [_Cries under the stage._] Swear.

1532 [_Beneath._] Swear.

1542 [_Beneath._] Swear.

1570 [_Beneath._] Swear.

1912 Most fair return of greetings and desires.
1913 Upon our first, he sent out to suppress
1914 His nephew’s levies, which to him appear’d
1915 To be a preparation ’gainst the Polack;
1916 But better look’d into, he truly found
1917 It was against your Highness; whereat griev’d,
1918 That so his sickness, age, and impotence
1919 Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests
1920 On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys,
1921 Receives rebuke from Norway; and in fine,
1922 Makes vow before his uncle never more
1923 To give th’assay of arms against your Majesty.
1924 Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,
1925 Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee,
1926 And his commission to employ those soldiers
1927 So levied as before, against the Polack:
1928 With an entreaty, herein further shown,
1929 [_Gives a paper._]
1930 That it might please you to give quiet pass
1931 Through your dominions for this enterprise,
1932 On such regards of safety and allowance
1933 As therein are set down.

1962 Madam, I swear I use no art at all.
1963 That he is mad, ’tis true: ’tis true ’tis pity;
1964 And pity ’tis ’tis true. A foolish figure,
1965 But farewell it, for I will use no art.
1966 Mad let us grant him then. And now remains
1967 That we find out the cause of this effect,
1968 Or rather say, the cause of this defect,
1969 For this effect defective comes by cause.
1970 Thus it remains, and the remainder thus. Perpend,
1971 I have a daughter—have whilst she is mine—
1972 Who in her duty and obedience, mark,
1973 Hath given me this. Now gather, and surmise.
1974 [_Reads._]
1975 _To the celestial, and my soul’s idol, the most beautified Ophelia_—
1976 That’s an ill phrase, a vile phrase; ‘beautified’ is a vile
1977 phrase: but you shall hear.
1978 [_Reads._]
1979 _these; in her excellent white bosom, these, &c._

1985 Good madam, stay awhile; I will be faithful.
1986 [_Reads._]
1987   _Doubt thou the stars are fire,
1988      Doubt that the sun doth move,
1989    Doubt truth to be a liar,
1990      But never doubt I love.
1991 O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers. I have not art to reckon my
1992 groans. But that I love thee best, O most best, believe it. Adieu.
1993   Thine evermore, most dear lady, whilst this machine is to him,
1994      HAMLET._
1995 This in obedience hath my daughter show’d me;
1996 And more above, hath his solicitings,
1997 As they fell out by time, by means, and place,
1998 All given to mine ear.

2047 Take this from this, if this be otherwise.
2048 [_Points to his head and shoulder._]
2049 If circumstances lead me, I will find
2050 Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed
2051 Within the centre.

2125 How say you by that? [_Aside._] Still harping on my daughter. Yet he
2126 knew me not at first; he said I was a fishmonger. He is far gone, far
2127 gone. And truly in my youth I suffered much extremity for love; very
2128 near this. I’ll speak to him again.—What do you read, my lord?

2152 [_Aside._] Though this be madness, yet there is a method in’t.—
2153 Will you walk out of the air, my lord?

2159 Indeed, that is out o’ the air. [_Aside._] How pregnant sometimes his
2160 replies are! A happiness that often madness hits on, which reason and
2161 sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of. I will leave him and
2162 suddenly contrive the means of meeting between him and my daughter.
2163 My honourable lord, I will most humbly take my leave of you.

2181 [_To Polonius._] God save you, sir.

2305 [_To Guildenstern._] What say you?

2308 [_Aside._] Nay, then I have an eye of you. If you love me, hold not
2309 off.

2482 [_Aside._] Still on my daughter.

2823 Ophelia, walk you here.—Gracious, so please you,
2824 We will bestow ourselves.—[_To Ophelia._] Read on this book,
2825 That show of such an exercise may colour
2826 Your loneliness.—We are oft to blame in this,
2827 ’Tis too much prov’d, that with devotion’s visage
2828 And pious action we do sugar o’er
2829 The devil himself.

2832 [_Aside._] O ’tis too true!
2833 How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!
2834 The harlot’s cheek, beautied with plastering art,
2835 Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it
2836 Than is my deed to my most painted word.
2837 O heavy burden!

3176 No, nor mine now. [_To Polonius._] My lord, you play’d once i’
3177 th’university, you say?

3203 [_To the King._] O ho! do you mark that?

3351 [_Aside._] Wormwood, wormwood.

3402 [_To Ophelia._] If she should break it now.

3405 ’Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile.
3406 My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile
3407 The tedious day with sleep.
3408 [_Sleeps._]

3883 [_Within._] Mother, mother, mother.

3935 [_Behind._] What, ho! help, help, help!

3938 How now? A rat? [_Draws._]
3939 Dead for a ducat, dead!

3944 [_Behind._] O, I am slain!

3967 Ay, lady, ’twas my word.—
3968 [_To Polonius._] Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!
3969 I took thee for thy better. Take thy fortune,
3970 Thou find’st to be too busy is some danger.—
3971 Leave wringing of your hands. Peace, sit you down,
3972 And let me wring your heart, for so I shall,
3973 If it be made of penetrable stuff;
3974 If damned custom have not braz’d it so,
3975 That it is proof and bulwark against sense.

4162 O throw away the worser part of it,
4163 And live the purer with the other half.
4164 Good night. But go not to mine uncle’s bed.
4165 Assume a virtue, if you have it not.
4166 That monster custom, who all sense doth eat,
4167 Of habits evil, is angel yet in this,
4168 That to the use of actions fair and good
4169 He likewise gives a frock or livery
4170 That aptly is put on. Refrain tonight,
4171 And that shall lend a kind of easiness
4172 To the next abstinence. The next more easy;
4173 For use almost can change the stamp of nature,
4174 And either curb the devil, or throw him out
4175 With wondrous potency. Once more, good night,
4176 And when you are desirous to be bles’d,
4177 I’ll blessing beg of you. For this same lord
4178 [_Pointing to Polonius._]
4179 I do repent; but heaven hath pleas’d it so,
4180 To punish me with this, and this with me,
4181 That I must be their scourge and minister.
4182 I will bestow him, and will answer well
4183 The death I gave him. So again, good night.
4184 I must be cruel, only to be kind:
4185 Thus bad begins, and worse remains behind.
4186 One word more, good lady.

4328 [_Within._] Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!

4465 [_To some Attendants._] Go seek him there.

4692 [_Sings._]
4693    How should I your true love know
4694      From another one?
4695    By his cockle bat and staff
4696      And his sandal shoon.

4702 Say you? Nay, pray you mark.
4703 [_Sings._]
4704    He is dead and gone, lady,
4705      He is dead and gone,
4706    At his head a grass green turf,
4707      At his heels a stone.

4713 Pray you mark.
4714 [_Sings._]
4715    White his shroud as the mountain snow.

4723 [_Sings._]
4724      Larded all with sweet flowers;
4725    Which bewept to the grave did go
4726      With true-love showers.

4739 Pray you, let’s have no words of this; but when they ask you what it
4740 means, say you this:
4741 [_Sings._]
4742    Tomorrow is Saint Valentine’s day,
4743      All in the morning betime,
4744    And I a maid at your window,
4745      To be your Valentine.

4756 Indeed la, without an oath, I’ll make an end on’t.
4757 [_Sings._]
4758    By Gis and by Saint Charity,
4759      Alack, and fie for shame!
4760    Young men will do’t if they come to’t;
4761      By Cock, they are to blame.

4935 [_Within._] Let her come in.

4954 [_Sings._]
4955    They bore him barefac’d on the bier,
4956    Hey no nonny, nonny, hey nonny
4957    And on his grave rain’d many a tear.—
4958    Fare you well, my dove!

4980 There’s fennel for you, and columbines. There’s rue for you; and here’s
4981 some for me. We may call it herb of grace o’ Sundays. O you must wear
4982 your rue with a difference. There’s a daisy. I would give you some
4983 violets, but they wither’d all when my father died. They say he made a
4984 good end.
4985 [_Sings._]
4986    For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.

4993 [_Sings._]
4994    And will he not come again?
4995    And will he not come again?
4996      No, no, he is dead,
4997      Go to thy death-bed,
4998    He never will come again.

5073 [_Reads._] ‘Horatio, when thou shalt have overlooked this, give these
5074 fellows some means to the King. They have letters for him. Ere we were
5075 two days old at sea, a pirate of very warlike appointment gave us
5076 chase. Finding ourselves too slow of sail, we put on a compelled
5077 valour, and in the grapple I boarded them. On the instant they got
5078 clear of our ship, so I alone became their prisoner. They have dealt
5079 with me like thieves of mercy. But they knew what they did; I am to do
5080 a good turn for them. Let the King have the letters I have sent, and
5081 repair thou to me with as much haste as thou wouldst fly death. I have
5082 words to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb; yet are they much too
5083 light for the bore of the matter. These good fellows will bring thee
5084 where I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their course for England:
5085 of them I have much to tell thee. Farewell.
5086      He that thou knowest thine,
5087      HAMLET.’

5533 [_Sings._]
5534    But age with his stealing steps
5535      Hath claw’d me in his clutch,
5536    And hath shipp’d me into the land,
5537      As if I had never been such.

5565 [_Sings._]
5566    A pickaxe and a spade, a spade,
5567      For and a shrouding-sheet;
5568    O, a pit of clay for to be made
5569      For such a guest is meet.

5601 Mine, sir.
5602 [_Sings._]
5603    O, a pit of clay for to be made
5604      For such a guest is meet.

5725 Let me see. [_Takes the skull._] Alas, poor Yorick. I knew him,
5726 Horatio, a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy. He hath
5727 borne me on his back a thousand times; and now, how abhorred in my
5728 imagination it is! My gorge rises at it. Here hung those lips that I
5729 have kiss’d I know not how oft. Where be your gibes now? your gambols?
5730 your songs? your flashes of merriment, that were wont to set the table
5731 on a roar? Not one now, to mock your own grinning? Quite chop-fallen?
5732 Now get you to my lady’s chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch
5733 thick, to this favour she must come. Make her laugh at that.—Prythee,
5734 Horatio, tell me one thing.

5823 [_Scattering flowers._] Sweets to the sweet. Farewell.
5824 I hop’d thou shouldst have been my Hamlet’s wife;
5825 I thought thy bride-bed to have deck’d, sweet maid,
5826 And not have strew’d thy grave.

5829 O, treble woe
5830 Fall ten times treble on that cursed head
5831 Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense
5832 Depriv’d thee of. Hold off the earth a while,
5833 Till I have caught her once more in mine arms.
5834 [_Leaps into the grave._]
5835 Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead,
5836 Till of this flat a mountain you have made,
5837 To o’ertop old Pelion or the skyish head
5838 Of blue Olympus.

5841 [_Advancing._]
5842 What is he whose grief
5843 Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow
5844 Conjures the wand’ring stars, and makes them stand
5845 Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,
5846 Hamlet the Dane.
5847 [_Leaps into the grave._]

5850 [_Grappling with him._] The devil take thy soul!

6456 [_Aside._] It is the poison’d cup; it is too late.

6471 [_Aside._] And yet ’tis almost ’gainst my conscience.
