330  But, soft, behold! Lo, where it comes again!
331  I’ll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!
332  If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
333  Speak to me.
334  If there be any good thing to be done,
335  That may to thee do ease, and grace to me,
336  Speak to me.
337  If thou art privy to thy country’s fate,
338  Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid,
339  O speak!
340  Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
341  Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,
342  For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,
343  Speak of it. Stay, and speak!

347  Stop it, Marcellus!

466  And now, Laertes, what’s the news with you?
467  You told us of some suit. What is’t, Laertes?
468  You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,
469  And lose your voice. What wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
470  That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
471  The head is not more native to the heart,
472  The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
473  Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
474  What wouldst thou have, Laertes?

849  My father’s spirit in arms! All is not well;
850  I doubt some foul play: would the night were come!
851  Till then sit still, my soul: foul deeds will rise,
852  Though all the earth o’erwhelm them, to men’s eyes.

932  A double blessing is a double grace;
933  Occasion smiles upon a second leave.

942  And these few precepts in thy memory
943  Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
944  Nor any unproportion’d thought his act.
945  Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.
946  Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
947  Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel;
948  But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
949  Of each new-hatch’d, unfledg’d comrade. Beware
950  Of entrance to a quarrel; but being in,
951  Bear’t that th’opposed may beware of thee.
952  Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice:
953  Take each man’s censure, but reserve thy judgment.
954  Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
955  But not express’d in fancy; rich, not gaudy:
956  For the apparel oft proclaims the man;
957  And they in France of the best rank and station
958  Are of a most select and generous chief in that.
959  Neither a borrower nor a lender be:
960  For loan oft loses both itself and friend;
961  And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
962  This above all: to thine own self be true;
963  And it must follow, as the night the day,
964  Thou canst not then be false to any man.
965  Farewell: my blessing season this in thee.

1086 What does this mean, my lord?

1212 Still am I call’d. Unhand me, gentlemen.

1216 By heaven, I’ll make a ghost of him that lets me.
1217 I say, away!—Go on, I’ll follow thee.

1401 So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word;
1402 It is ‘Adieu, adieu, remember me.’
1403 I have sworn’t.

1731 How now, Ophelia, what’s the matter?

1896 He tells me, my sweet queen, that he hath found
1897 The head and source of all your son’s distemper.

1908 Welcome, my good friends!
1909 Say, Voltemand, what from our brother Norway?

2085 How does my good Lord Hamlet?

2507 You are welcome, masters, welcome all. I am glad to see thee well.
2508 Welcome, good friends. O, my old friend! Thy face is valanc’d since I
2509 saw thee last. Com’st thou to beard me in Denmark? What, my young lady
2510 and mistress! By’r lady, your ladyship is nearer to heaven than when I
2511 saw you last, by the altitude of a chopine. Pray God your voice, like a
2512 piece of uncurrent gold, be not cracked within the ring. Masters, you
2513 are all welcome. We’ll e’en to’t like French falconers, fly at anything
2514 we see. We’ll have a speech straight. Come, give us a taste of your
2515 quality. Come, a passionate speech.

2645 Dost thou hear me, old friend? Can you play _The Murder of Gonzago_?

2663 [_To Rosencrantz and Guildenstern_] My good friends, I’ll leave you
2664 till night. You are welcome to Elsinore.

3086 How now, my lord?
3087 Will the King hear this piece of work?

3097 Will you two help to hasten them?

3261 _Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly; the Queen embracing him and he
3262 her. She kneels, and makes show of protestation unto him. He takes her
3263 up, and declines his head upon her neck. Lays him down upon a bank of
3264 flowers. She, seeing him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow,
3265 takes off his crown, kisses it, pours poison in the King’s ears, and
3266 exits. The Queen returns, finds the King dead, and makes passionate
3267 action. The Poisoner with some three or four Mutes, comes in again,
3268 seeming to lament with her. The dead body is carried away. The Poisoner
3269 woos the Queen with gifts. She seems loth and unwilling awhile, but in
3270 the end accepts his love._

3443 This is one Lucianus, nephew to the King.

3637 O, the recorders. Let me see one.—To withdraw with you, why do you go
3638 about to recover the wind of me, as if you would drive me into a toil?

3681 God bless you, sir.

3718 ’Tis now the very witching time of night,
3719 When churchyards yawn, and hell itself breathes out
3720 Contagion to this world. Now could I drink hot blood,
3721 And do such bitter business as the day
3722 Would quake to look on. Soft now, to my mother.
3723 O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever
3724 The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom:
3725 Let me be cruel, not unnatural.
3726 I will speak daggers to her, but use none;
3727 My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites.
3728 How in my words somever she be shent,
3729 To give them seals never, my soul, consent.

3795 O, my offence is rank, it smells to heaven;
3796 It hath the primal eldest curse upon’t,—
3797 A brother’s murder! Pray can I not,
3798 Though inclination be as sharp as will:
3799 My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent,
3800 And, like a man to double business bound,
3801 I stand in pause where I shall first begin,
3802 And both neglect. What if this cursed hand
3803 Were thicker than itself with brother’s blood,
3804 Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens
3805 To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy
3806 But to confront the visage of offence?
3807 And what’s in prayer but this twofold force,
3808 To be forestalled ere we come to fall,
3809 Or pardon’d being down? Then I’ll look up.
3810 My fault is past. But O, what form of prayer
3811 Can serve my turn? Forgive me my foul murder!
3812 That cannot be; since I am still possess’d
3813 Of those effects for which I did the murder,—
3814 My crown, mine own ambition, and my queen.
3815 May one be pardon’d and retain th’offence?
3816 In the corrupted currents of this world
3817 Offence’s gilded hand may shove by justice,
3818 And oft ’tis seen the wicked prize itself
3819 Buys out the law. But ’tis not so above;
3820 There is no shuffling, there the action lies
3821 In his true nature, and we ourselves compell’d
3822 Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,
3823 To give in evidence. What then? What rests?
3824 Try what repentance can. What can it not?
3825 Yet what can it, when one cannot repent?
3826 O wretched state! O bosom black as death!
3827 O limed soul, that struggling to be free,
3828 Art more engag’d! Help, angels! Make assay:
3829 Bow, stubborn knees; and heart with strings of steel,
3830 Be soft as sinews of the new-born babe.
3831 All may be well.

4070 Save me and hover o’er me with your wings,
4071 You heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?

4259 Ah, my good lord, what have I seen tonight!

4301 Friends both, go join you with some further aid:
4302 Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,
4303 And from his mother’s closet hath he dragg’d him.
4304 Go seek him out, speak fair, and bring the body
4305 Into the chapel. I pray you haste in this.

4309 Come, Gertrude, we’ll call up our wisest friends,
4310 And let them know both what we mean to do
4311 And what’s untimely done, so haply slander,
4312 Whose whisper o’er the world’s diameter,
4313 As level as the cannon to his blank,
4314 Transports his poison’d shot, may miss our name,
4315 And hit the woundless air. O, come away!
4316 My soul is full of discord and dismay.

4405 How now? What hath befall’n?

4514 And England, if my love thou hold’st at aught,—
4515 As my great power thereof may give thee sense,
4516 Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red
4517 After the Danish sword, and thy free awe
4518 Pays homage to us,—thou mayst not coldly set
4519 Our sovereign process, which imports at full,
4520 By letters conjuring to that effect,
4521 The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;
4522 For like the hectic in my blood he rages,
4523 And thou must cure me. Till I know ’tis done,
4524 Howe’er my haps, my joys were ne’er begun.

4607 How all occasions do inform against me,
4608 And spur my dull revenge. What is a man
4609 If his chief good and market of his time
4610 Be but to sleep and feed? A beast, no more.
4611 Sure he that made us with such large discourse,
4612 Looking before and after, gave us not
4613 That capability and godlike reason
4614 To fust in us unus’d. Now whether it be
4615 Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple
4616 Of thinking too precisely on th’event,—
4617 A thought which, quarter’d, hath but one part wisdom
4618 And ever three parts coward,—I do not know
4619 Why yet I live to say this thing’s to do,
4620 Sith I have cause, and will, and strength, and means
4621 To do’t. Examples gross as earth exhort me,
4622 Witness this army of such mass and charge,
4623 Led by a delicate and tender prince,
4624 Whose spirit, with divine ambition puff’d,
4625 Makes mouths at the invisible event,
4626 Exposing what is mortal and unsure
4627 To all that fortune, death, and danger dare,
4628 Even for an eggshell. Rightly to be great
4629 Is not to stir without great argument,
4630 But greatly to find quarrel in a straw
4631 When honour’s at the stake. How stand I then,
4632 That have a father kill’d, a mother stain’d,
4633 Excitements of my reason and my blood,
4634 And let all sleep, while to my shame I see
4635 The imminent death of twenty thousand men
4636 That, for a fantasy and trick of fame,
4637 Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot
4638 Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,
4639 Which is not tomb enough and continent
4640 To hide the slain? O, from this time forth,
4641 My thoughts be bloody or be nothing worth.

4678 To my sick soul, as sin’s true nature is,
4679 Each toy seems prologue to some great amiss.
4680 So full of artless jealousy is guilt,
4681 It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.

4747    Then up he rose and donn’d his clothes,
4748      And dupp’d the chamber door,
4749    Let in the maid, that out a maid
4750      Never departed more.

4763    Quoth she, before you tumbled me,
4764      You promis’d me to wed.
4765    So would I ha’ done, by yonder sun,
4766      An thou hadst not come to my bed.

4784 O, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs
4785 All from her father’s death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,
4786 When sorrows come, they come not single spies,
4787 But in battalions. First, her father slain;
4788 Next, your son gone; and he most violent author
4789 Of his own just remove; the people muddied,
4790 Thick and and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers
4791 For good Polonius’ death; and we have done but greenly
4792 In hugger-mugger to inter him. Poor Ophelia
4793 Divided from herself and her fair judgment,
4794 Without the which we are pictures or mere beasts.
4795 Last, and as much containing as all these,
4796 Her brother is in secret come from France,
4797 Feeds on his wonder, keeps himself in clouds,
4798 And wants not buzzers to infect his ear
4799 With pestilent speeches of his father’s death,
4800 Wherein necessity, of matter beggar’d,
4801 Will nothing stick our person to arraign
4802 In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,
4803 Like to a murdering piece, in many places
4804 Gives me superfluous death.

4816 What is the matter?

4942 O heat, dry up my brains. Tears seven times salt,
4943 Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye.
4944 By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight,
4945 Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!
4946 Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!
4947 O heavens, is’t possible a young maid’s wits
4948 Should be as mortal as an old man’s life?
4949 Nature is fine in love, and where ’tis fine,
4950 It sends some precious instance of itself
4951 After the thing it loves.

5000    His beard was as white as snow,
5001    All flaxen was his poll.
5002      He is gone, he is gone,
5003      And we cast away moan.
5004    God ha’ mercy on his soul.

5006 And of all Christian souls, I pray God. God b’ wi’ ye.

5056 I do not know from what part of the world
5057 I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.

5089 Come, I will give you way for these your letters,
5090 And do’t the speedier, that you may direct me
5091 To him from whom you brought them.

5148 How now? What news?

5168 [_Reads._] ‘High and mighty, you shall know I am set naked on your
5169 kingdom. Tomorrow shall I beg leave to see your kingly eyes. When I
5170 shall, first asking your pardon thereunto, recount the occasions of my
5171 sudden and more strange return.
5172      HAMLET.’

5174 What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?
5175 Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?

5351 How now, sweet Queen?

5515 [_Digs and sings._]

5517    In youth when I did love, did love,
5518      Methought it was very sweet;
5519    To contract, O, the time for, a, my behove,
5520      O methought there was nothing meet.

5775 The Queen, the courtiers. Who is that they follow?
5776 And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken
5777 The corse they follow did with desperate hand
5778 Fordo it own life. ’Twas of some estate.
5779 Couch we awhile and mark.

5925 [_To Laertes_]
5926 Strengthen your patience in our last night’s speech;
5927 We’ll put the matter to the present push.—
5928 Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.
5929 This grave shall have a living monument.
5930 An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;
5931 Till then in patience our proceeding be.

6235 He does well to commend it himself, there are no tongues else for’s
6236 turn.

6426 Give him the cup.

6433 Come. Another hit; what say you?

6597 What warlike noise is this?
